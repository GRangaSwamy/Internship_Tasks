I developed this Bootstrap 5 Internship Task project entirely using my own knowledge and understanding of front-end web development. I learned Bootstrap during my second year of B.Tech, where I practiced building responsive layouts and explored its core components such as Navbar, Cards, Carousel, Forms, Modals, and Footer.

The goal of this task was to design a responsive single-page website using Bootstrap 5 while maintaining a clean structure and consistent styling. I started by setting up the basic HTML, linking Bootstrap through CDN, and then progressively added components section by section.

All the code structure, layout design, and component integration were done by me.
I used ChatGPT only for UI suggestions and minor animation ideas, not for writing or generating the complete code. Every section — from the Navbar to the Footer — was built manually using the Bootstrap documentation and my own understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Through this project, I enhanced my confidence in responsive design, layout composition, and component-based web development. It helped me strengthen my grasp of Bootstrap utilities, spacing, and grid system while improving my practical front-end coding skills.
